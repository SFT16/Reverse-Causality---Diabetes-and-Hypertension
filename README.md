# Reverse-Causality---Diabetes-and-Hypertension

## Overview
This project aims to understand reverse causal inference between diabetes and hypertension, specifically to understand if hypertension may serve as an indicator of type-2 diabetes. We explore prominent type-2 diabetes risk factors and whether they realte to hypertension.

## Dataset
We use the de-itenified Adultes NHANES dataset from 2011-2012, accessed through data.world. The dataset comprises of 5206 patient records with 71 variables.
